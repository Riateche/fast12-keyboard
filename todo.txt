Ri Keyboard
===========

Todo:
* Key repeating when user holds a button 
* Insert arbitrary symbol (search by unicode descriptions)
* CL -> Clear, add localization 
* Declare locales (http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/text/creating-input-method.html)
* Switch to requested locale (check in Opera, check for email/text input)
* Remember last layout (already works?)
* Implement settings
* Vibration
